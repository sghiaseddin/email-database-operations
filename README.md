# Educated Email Guesser & Undelivered Email Highlighter

This Google Apps Script project automates email generation and validation within Google Sheets. It provides two key functionalities:

1. **Educated Email Guessing** - Generates possible email addresses based on full names, domain names, and a predefined pattern.
2. **Undelivered Email Highlighter** - Highlights email addresses in red if they appear in a list of undelivered emails.
3. **Listing Same-Domain Emails** - Extracts and lists emails from protected sheets within the same domain.
4. **Get Business Description** - Request for business name using Google Custom Search JSON API, and get the title and description.
5. **Get Business Name** - Request for exact business name using Ollama API on localhost.

- Version: 1.0.0
- @tag listing same domain with insights

## Features

#### 1. Email Generation

- **Function**: `generateEmailGuesses()`
- **Description**: This function generates possible email variations based on patterns, full names, and domains provided in your spreadsheet.
- **Key Points**:
  - Uses predefined patterns (e.g., "Name.Surname", "NSurname").
  - Generates emails by combining the pattern with the domain.
  - Writes the generated emails to a specified column in your sheet.

#### 2. Highlighting Undelivered Emails

- **Function**: `highlightUndeliveredEmails()`
- **Description**: This function highlights rows where the email is not present in a provided list of valid or delivered emails.
- **Key Points**:
  - Compares each email in your spreadsheet with a list of valid emails.
  - Highlights mismatched emails (undelivered emails) for easy identification.

#### 3. Listing Same-Domain Emails from Protected Sheets

- **Function**: `listEmailsSameDomainProtected()`
- **Description**: This function extracts and lists emails from protected sheets within the same domain.
- **Key Points**:
  - Accesses data from a protected sheet (e.g., "Protected Sheet" named in your spreadsheet).
  - Filters and lists emails that belong to the same domain.

#### 4. Password Hashing for Authentication

- **Function**: `hashPassword()`
- **Description**: This function securely hashes passwords using SHA-256 algorithm.
- **Key Points**:
  - Converts plain-text passwords into hashed values for secure storage.
  - Used for authenticating users accessing the script's features.

#### 5. Custom Menu Integration

- **Function**: `onOpen()`
- **Description**: This function creates a custom menu in your Google Sheet with various options to access the script's functionalities.
- **Key Points**:
  - Adds menu items like "Generate Email Guesses," "Highlight Undelivered Emails," and more.
  - Simplifies navigation and usage of the script's features.

## Installation

#### 1. Prerequisites

- Ensure you have a Google Sheet with the necessary data (e.g., full names, domains, patterns).
- Familiarize yourself with Google Apps Script basics.
- Set up any protected sheets if required by your functions.

#### 2. Getting Started

- Open your Google Sheet and go to `Extensions > App Script`.
- Copy and paste your code into the script editor.
- Save your project with a meaningful name (e.g., "Email Generator & Analyzer").
- Test each function individually to ensure they work as expected.

#### 3. Using the Custom Menu

- After deploying your script, open your Google Sheet.
- Click on the custom menu you created (e.g., "Email Tools").
- Use the options provided to generate emails, highlight undelivered emails, and more.

### Known Limitations

- The email generation function is limited to predefined patterns. If you need additional patterns, youâ€™ll have to modify the code.
- Highlighting undelivered emails requires a valid list of delivered emails to compare against. Without this list, the function wonâ€™t work as intended.
- Password hashing is implemented but not integrated with user authentication. Youâ€™ll need to add user authentication if required.

### Best Practices

- Always handle sensitive data (like passwords) securely.
- Regularly test your script for errors and performance issues.
- Document your code thoroughly so that others can understand and maintain it.

## Usage

### **1. Generate Email Guesses**

- Click on **Custom Scripts â†’ Generate Email Guesses**.
- The script will process all rows and populate the `EmailGuess` column based on the selected pattern.

### **2. Highlight Undelivered Emails**

- Click on **Custom Scripts â†’ Highlight Undelivered Emails**.
- The script will check each email in the `Europe` sheet against the `Undelivered` sheet.
- Matching emails will be highlighted in **red**.

### **3. List Same-Domain Emails from Protected Sheets**
- Click on **Custom Scripts â†’ List Same-Domain Emails**.
- This function extracts and lists emails from a protected sheet (e.g., named "Protected Sheet") within the same domain.
- The extracted emails will be displayed in a new tab or highlighted in the spreadsheet.

### **4. Password Hashing**
- Click on **Custom Scripts â†’ Generate Password Hash**.
- A form will appear where you can input a password.
- After submitting, the script will generate a secure hash of the password (e.g., using SHA-256).
- The hashed value will be displayed in the spreadsheet or stored in a specified location.
